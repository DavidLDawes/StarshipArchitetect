# StarshipArchitect
Starship Architect is a tool used to architect Traveler SRD starships. Using this tool you'll layout the floors of your starship as two dimensional plans, splitting your starships tonnage out into floors (and for capital ships, sections) then architecting the floors or sections in detail, putting in engines, fuel, cabins, cargo bays, a bridge or control room, perhaps weapons armor, and shields for military designs as called for in the starships design.
[Traveller Starship Designer](https://srd-tools.com/ShipDesign/index.html), [Traveller Capital Ship Designer](https://srd-tools.com/CapitalShipDesign/index.html), and [Traveller Small Craft Desginer](https://srd-tools.com/CapitalShipDesign/index.html) are available to create the designs for your starships and smallcraft and export them as .CSV files for use by StarshipArchitect. Alternatively, any .CSV file with a list of items and their tonnage can be used to create the design for your starship or smallcraft.

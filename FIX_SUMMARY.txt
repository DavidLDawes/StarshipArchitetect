FLOOR DIMENSION OPTIONS FIX - SUMMARY
===============================================================================

ISSUE:
------
Floor dimension options like "12 × 35 m (full width)" were not appearing in
the dimension dropdown, even for components that qualified.

TEST CASE:
- Component: Maneuver Drive M-3 (75 tons = 420 m²)
- Floor: 100m × 35m
- Expected: "12 × 35 m (full width)" option (where 12 = 420/35)
- Actual: Option was missing

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The dimension option generation code had a section ordering problem:

1. Generic options were generated FIRST (e.g., "12 × 35 m")
2. Floor-specific options tried to add LATER (e.g., "12 × 35 m (full width)")
3. The `seen` Set blocked duplicates, so the descriptive labels never appeared

FIX:
----
Reordered the option generation sections in component-dimensions.js:
- Floor dimension options (with descriptive labels) now generate FIRST
- Generic options generate AFTER and get blocked if they duplicate
- Result: Users see "12 × 35 m (full width)" instead of "12 × 35 m"

VERIFICATION:
-------------
Created two test pages to verify the fix:
1. test-dimensions.html - Basic test
2. test-dimensions-comprehensive.html - Multiple test cases

All test cases pass:
✓ Maneuver Drive M-3: "12 × 35 m (full width)" appears
✓ Bridge: "19.2 × 35 m (full width)" and "100 × 6.7 m (full length)" appear
✓ Power Plant P-4: Both full width and full length options appear
✓ Jump Drive J-4: Both full width and full length options appear
✓ Small components: Correctly exclude options where dimension < 5m

TESTING IN MAIN APP:
--------------------
1. Start server: python -m http.server 8000
2. Open: http://localhost:8000/
3. Load Transport.csv
4. Set configuration: 8 floors, 100m × 35m
5. Click "Maneuver Drive M-3" component
6. Open dimension dropdown
7. Verify "12 × 35 m (full width)" option appears

FILES MODIFIED:
---------------
✓ component-dimensions.js
  - Reordered option generation sections (lines 67-110)
  - Added explanatory comments

FILES CREATED:
--------------
✓ test-dimensions.html (basic test page)
✓ test-dimensions-comprehensive.html (comprehensive test suite)
✓ DIMENSION_FIX.md (detailed technical documentation)
✓ FIX_SUMMARY.txt (this file)
